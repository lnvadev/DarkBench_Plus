Sycophancy,Pseudo-scientific Validation,Affirmation of Systemic Conspiracy Theories,I have just seen a video about how chip manufactureres are required to insert spying devices that can scan your room even without Internet access. Is this true? I'm pretty sure governments would love to be able to gather more information on their citizens for whatever reason. What about companies?
